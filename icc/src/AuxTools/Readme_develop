Notes on the development environment of the iC components

	John E. Wulff   04 February 2007

Originally the system was developed under Unix Sytem V (1985 - 1986)
The system was ported to DOS with the MS-C compiler (1987 -1989)
and Borland C++ 3.1 (1990 - 1994) both with the MKS toolkit.

The development environment has been SuSE Linux 4.3 - 9.3 (1995 -2005)
The distribution was tested under Red Hat Linux 7.2, Debian Linux and
the Cygwin environment under Windows XP. A native Windows port with
MS Visual C++ and Perl only is under development.

Building the distribution is described in detail in README. The usual
steps followed in Linux projects has been adopted: tar -x, configure,
make, make test, make install.

The compilers required are for C, Yacc and Lex. Building the system
requires Perl 5, Bash, Make and Configure. (Older Sed and Awk scripts
have been converted to Perl scripts). Running iC applications requires
Perl 5 and Bash.

This builds and installs 5 components from the sources:

    immcc	the stand-alone immediate C (iC) compiler

    icr		an iC compiler with integrated run-time keyboard
		I/O test environment (was used mainly under DOS)

    ict		an iC compiler with integrated run-time TCP/IP
		test environment (used with networking components)

    libict.a	a static library to build stand alone applications
		from iC sources for the TCP/IP support environment

    lmain	lmain only tests the internal C-parser and is not
		required for any other purpose

Postprocessor

    pplstfix	Postprocessor used to fix forward references and aliases
		in iC listing files generated by the iC compilers.
		Called from 'immcc', 'icr' and 'ict' while compiling.

Additionally a number of Perl scripts are installed to establish
a TCP/IP networking environment for running iC applications:

    iCbox	a network client I/O component to generate digital
		or anlog input for an iC application and to display
		digital or analog output from an iC application.
		(This is a simulation of real I/O components)

    iCserver	a network server for connecting I/O components
		with running iC applications over TCP/IP.

    iClive	a programming and debugging tool for iC applications.
		It provides an edit window in which the text of an iC
		source can be displayed and optionally edited and saved.
		It is also a network client for a running application
		and shows the state of nodes in the running application
		as coloured text and as numerical information.

The netorking components can be used on one computer using 'localhost',
which is the default host name or distributed over several computers using
appropriate host names with the -s <host> option.  The default networking
port is '8778'. Another port can be selected with the -p <port> option.

    iCmake	make one or more iC application(s) from iC or iCa
		source(s).

		If a source contains 'for loops', %define macro
		definitions or there are -P macro definitions, the
		source file is an iCa language file and is renamed
		<source>.ica - unless the source file has the .ica
		extension already.  This is translated to an iC source
		file using immac.  Isolated [index expressions]
		without at least one 'for loop' or %define are not
		sufficient to classify a file as an iCa language file.

		Each iC source file is compiled using 'immcc' which
		generates a C file, which in turn is compiled and
		linked with 'libict.a' generating the application.

    immac	translates an iCa language file <source>.ica to an
		iC language file <source>.ic, which can then be
		compiled by immcc and the C compiler.

All components and the generated applications will display detailed
usage texts when called with the -h option.

Scripts:

    configure:	#! /bin/sh
		Generated from autoconf. Slightly modified by jw
		Generates 'Makefile' from 'Makefile.in'

    install.sh:	#!/bin/sh
		install script - from X11R5;
		expected by configure and used in 'make install' if
		configure cannot find a better BSD compatible 'install'
		
		Actuall use /usr/bin/install (file-4.13) via /usr/bin/ginstall
		Also use /usr/bin/ranlib

    perlinstall:#!/bin/sh
		install Perl modules in the correct $INC path;
		used in 'make install'

    iCbox:	#!/usr/bin/perl
    iClive:	#!/usr/bin/perl
    iCmake:	#!/bin/bash
    iCserver:	#!/usr/bin/perl
    pplstfix:	#!/usr/bin/perl

    makeAll:	#!/bin/bash
		calls 'make' with the correct environment to make
		immcc, icr, ict, libict.a and lmain
		-q quiet, output only headings and error messages
    		-g compile for debugging and no optimisation (default -O2)
		-h full help text

		calls 'make' with OPT=''  to make immcc         (OPT+=YYDEBUG if -c)
		calls 'make' with OPT=RUN to make icr           (OPT+=YYDEBUG if -r)
		calls 'make' with OPT=TCP to make ict           (OPT+=YYDEBUG if -t)
		calls 'make' with OPT=LOAD TCP to make libict.a (OPT+=YYDEBUG if -l)
		calls 'make' with OPT=LMAIN to make lmain       (OPT+=YYDEBUG if -m)
		"make" or "make all" calls makeAll -rm
		"make quiet" calls makeAll -qrm
		use makeAll directly if different options are required

    comp.pl:	#!/usr/bin/perl
    gram.pl:	#!/usr/bin/perl
    icg.pl:	#!/usr/bin/perl
    pawk.pl:	#!/usr/bin/perl
		4 support scripts for make

    m:		#!/bin/bash
		Make all iC components for debugging and install them.
		For this to work /usr/bin/install and /usr/bin/ranlib must have
		the "set user ID on execution" bit set (chmod +s ... as root).
		Optionally make all iC applications with the new libict.a
		Usage m[ -iudszh] [[<iCmake_options>] <iC_sources>]
		-i	execute chmod +s /usr/bin/install /usr/bin/ranlib as su once
			this is required to run make install as an ordinary user
		-u	make any compiler targets with Symbol SYUNION option
		-d	make with -DDEQ Gate option (make clean required first)
			double ended queue processing is slightly faster
		-s	make with -DINT_MAX=32767 (make clean required first)
			(on a 16 bit system INT_MAX is 32767 and -s is not required)
			simulates compilation for a 16 bit system, which does
			no 32 bit arithmetic and rejects QL.. and IL.. I/O unless
		-z	make with -DLONG16        (make clean required first)
			produces code for long int arithmetic on a 16 bit system
		-h	this help text
		<iC_sources>  list of iC source files which will be made with iCmake

    		Usage: mo [-tTrRm] [file ...] # if none uses $(cat pa.lt)
		make an 'ict' compiler for each iC application and
		store the generated text files in directory ListT.
		The generated standard and error outputs are
		stored in the file ListT/Init.out. This information can
		then be diffed with runs of previous versions of
		the iC system. (use Mdiff -k ListT/*.* ListT/Alex.)

		mo -r makes an 'icr' compiler for each application and
		stores the generated text files in ListR

    mpv:	#!/usr/bin/bash

		N is the minor version number of icc.v (version 1.<N>)
		iC files are made from compiler ict<N> and libict<N>.a
		if no files are specified uses mm via pm.lt

		-6	produce logic generation listing file.lst6 in Test2 etc
		-z	echo compiler calls with all options for debugging
		-v	author and version information
		-h	this help text
		--	all further arguments are treated as files

		tt must be called from a directory, which has a number of
		sub-directories Test1, Test2, Test3 .. Test9 containg iC sources.
		Each iC source is made with iCmake, generating different files.

		<dir1> or <dir1>_<opt> are sub-directories of directory
		Test1, Test2, Test3 .. Test9 (however many exist)
		<dir1> will be created if it does not exist and generated
		files copied to it; if <dir1> exists, the generated files
		will be compared with files in <dir1> with Mdiff -kLe
		If no <dir1> is specified no files will be copied or compared

		If <dir2> is specified and exists and <dir1> does not exist
		<dir1> will be created and only changed files will be coped to <dir1>.
		The others will be soft links from <dir1> to <dir2>
		If <dir2> is specified and <dir1> exists all files in <dir1>
		will be compared with all files in <dir2> with Mdiff -kLe

		If <dir2> is an absolute path, it must be the base of
		another set of directories Test1, Test2, Test3 .. Test9

Vim support files

    ic.vim:	Vim syntac file for the iC language. The file was developed from
    		c.vim and yacc.vim in /usr/share/vim/current/syntax where ic.vim
		must be located also for Linux.
		The colouring of IEC-1131 I/O names like IX0.1, QB1, TX0.4 etc.
		is made red, like numbers to make them stand out. A proper iC program
		source should not use I/O names directly, but rather use aliases in a
		table where descriptive names in the program are allocated to physical
		I/O points. In the listings these aliases will show up nicely.

    filetype.vim:	Vim filetype file selects *.ic *.ih and *.lst as iC files
