 *	QX0 outputs the value of a shift register made up of SR flip
 *	flops m0 to m7. These are clocked by an internally generated
 *	clock c0. It looks like running lights when displayed.
 *
 *	By changing the input IB4 the clocking speed on m0 to m7,
 *	which is output on QX0.0 to QX0.7 is set to IB4 * 50 ms.
 *	A value of 0 on input IB4 lets you clock the running
 *	lights manually via input IX0.0
 *
 *	Output QX1.0 indicates the direction of the running
 *	lights on QX0 - just to show a bit of internal logic.
