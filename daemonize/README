			  daemonize, version 1.0

INTRODUCTION

daemonize is a trivial utility that runs a command as a Unix daemon. 
See the accompanying man page for full details.


INSTALLATION

Normal installation:

	$ sh configure
	$ make
	$ su 
	# make install

For a detailed report of the available "configure" options:

	$ sh configure --help


NOTES

1. I have personally compiled and tested daemonize on the following platforms:

   - FreeBSD 4.x
   - Mandrake Linux 8.1
   - Red Hat Linux 6.2
   - Red Hat Linux 8.0
   - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 / CentOS 4
   - Solaris (SunOS 5.8)
   - Fedora Core 5

2. The accompanying "configure" script was generated with GNU autoconf
   version 2.1.3. It should work, as is, for most Unix systems.
